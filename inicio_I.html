            <i><h2>Nutritional characteristics of marmalade:</h2></i>
            <p>The main nutritional characteristics of the jam are its low content of fats and proteins, and its high percentage of simple sugars. Do not forget that, once cooked, about 2/3 of the final mixture that compose it is sugar. However, it is not excessively caloric products. For example, 25 g of jam (which is what we would use in two toasts) contains 64.5 Kcal and 15.65 g of sugar, the equivalent of two sachets. For that reason, they should be consumed with moderation and are advised against in diabetic people.<br><br>
                Its consumption is also not recommended in overweight or obese people who are in treatment of weight loss. However, we must not forget that they can provide a point of satisfaction in the hypocaloric diet, so it is always better to reach an agreement with the dietitian-nutritionist to integrate them into the diet in case the patient so wishes.<br><br>
                Regarding the consumption of jams by children, it should also be moderate and always in combination with other foods. Keep in mind that jams and preserves do not replace fresh fruit, so it is not a valid alternative for children (and adults) who do not eat this type of food.<br><br></p>
